# PyMediaShrinker

This script compresses images, GIFs, and videos in a given input directory and writes the compressed files to an output directory. It uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image compression, the `gifsicle` command-line tool for GIF optimization, and the `moviepy` library for video compression.

## Supported Formats

- Images: PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- GIFs: GIF (.gif)
- Videos: MP4 (.mp4)

## Requirements

- PIL
- moviepy
- gifsicle

## Usage
1. Upon opening the script, you will be prompted to choose an input folder. **THE SCRIPT WILL CONVERT EVERYTHING SUPPORTED THAT IS INSIDE THAT FOLDER**.
2. Then you can choose an output folder.
3. Voil√†! The script will do its magic.

## Config
You can set the config at the top of the script:

They include the image quality (the lower the number, the worse it will be), the video bitrate and the name of the temporary folder (which will be automatically created if missing).

## Exemple
I've tried it out on a folder containing a total of 3360 images, videos and gifs combined (for a total of 5.01 go). After convertion with these settings:

It was reduced to 851 mo while keeping acceptable quality.
